# DeFi Guardian: Your Cross-Chain Financial Safety Net

**Description:**  
Navigating the complex world of DeFi across multiple blockchains has always been a challenging feat. DeFi Guardian emerges as a revolutionary solution, offering a seamless cross-chain liquidation protection, interest rate optimization system, and innovative debt-position NFTs, all empowered by Chainlink CCIP. Dive into a safer, smarter, and more integrated DeFi experience.

## ðŸŒŸ Features:

### 1. **Unified Liquidation Protection**:
   - Manage debt positions across varied protocols (e.g., Benqi on Avalanche, Compound on Polygon).
   - All liquidity is securely stored in one vault (default: Aave on Ethereum).
   - Smart "Automation" monitoring for each debt position. If a loan threatens to breach the liquidation threshold, our system instantly requests remedial action.
   - Effortless cross-chain communication: When the Ethereum vault gets the warning, it swiftly dispatches funds to cover the risky loan, preserving your financial health.

### 2. **Smart Interest Rate Optimizer**:
   - A built-in JavaScript function assesses interest rates across major lending protocols on all chains.
   - If you're overpaying on interest, the system autonomously strategizes to repay the loan, potentially refinancing it at a better rate.

### 3. **Debt-based Cross-Chain NFTs**:
   - Tokenize your debt positions as unique NFTs, allowing for transparent, tradeable, and flexible financial instruments.
   - Use NFTs as collateral in other DeFi protocols, enabling innovative financing and lending scenarios.
   - Benefit from fractional ownership and potentially create new markets for trading debt positions.

### 4. **Safe Wallet Liquidity Storage**:
   - Store your liquidity securely on a single chain with our "Safe Wallet" feature, ensuring a consolidated view and control over your funds.
   - Maintain financial sovereignty and optimize for gas costs and transaction efficiency.

### 5. **Customizable Infrastructure**:
   - By default, the Liquidation Protection Smart Contract (LPSC) is deployed on the `ethereumSepolia` chain.
   - For those who love to tinker, adjust the `defaultNetwork` property in the `hardhat.config.ts` to customize your main liquidity chain.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started:

1. **Deploy LPSC**: Start by deploying the Liquidation Protection Smart Contract on your liquidity chain.
2. **Set Up Automation**: For every chain where you've taken a loan, deploy the Monitor contract to keep a watchful eye on your debt ratios.
3. **Optional - Rate Checker**: Activate the JavaScript function to keep a check on prevailing interest rates, ensuring you always get the best deal.
